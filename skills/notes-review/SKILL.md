# Notes Review

Review raw research notes (bullet points, ad hoc ideas) and prepare them for writing an article or post.

## Input

The user will provide unstructured bullet points — research notes, ideas, observations collected while exploring a topic.

## Review Process

### 1. Summarize

Write a concise summary (3-5 sentences) capturing the core thesis and main arguments from the notes.

### 2. Assess Consistency

- Are the ideas coherent? Do they support a unified thesis?
- Flag any contradictions or tensions between points.
- Identify points that feel tangential or don't fit the main thread.

### 3. Assess Quality

- Which ideas are strongest and most interesting?
- Which points are vague, obvious, or underdeveloped?
- Are any claims that need a source or evidence missing one?

### 4. Validate

- Fact-check specific claims where possible (use web search if needed).
- Flag anything that seems incorrect or oversimplified.

### 5. Suggest Additions

- Propose related ideas, angles, or examples that strengthen the thesis.
- Identify gaps — what's missing that a reader would expect?
- Suggest counterarguments worth addressing.

## Output Format

Present the review as:

- **Summary**: Core thesis in 3-5 sentences
- **Consistency**: Are the ideas coherent? Any contradictions?
- **Strongest ideas**: What stands out
- **Weak spots**: What needs work or evidence
- **Suggestions**: New ideas, missing angles, counterarguments to address
- **Verdict**: Overall assessment — is this ready to outline, or does it need more research?
